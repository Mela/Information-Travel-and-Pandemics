   "source": "# Information Travel and Epidemics\n## Introduction\nInformation spreading changes the behaviour of individuals and thus a population during a pandemic significantly. In this analysis, we want to study the effect of information spreading on containing an epidemic. Our work is based on [Funk et al. 2009](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0810762106). The paper's conclusion is that high quality information can change human behaviour. To replicate their results, we extend a basic SIR-Model with an awareness component. The model we created is based on our research questions: \n\n1. “Which conditions can lead to outbreaks being contained by the information spread?” \n\n2. “What is the impact of self-isolation of knowingly infected individuals on the spread of a disease and under which conditions is it most impactful?”\n\nBased on the study of Funk et al, we assume that information quality decreases after a certain time and number of individuals passing information on ([grapevine effect](https://phys.org/news/2019-07-grapevine-effect.html)). We extended the original model with further aspects like the isolation rate. We would like to investigate how the infection changes after an individual is infected and isolates under what circumstances the isolation would be particularly successful. \n\n**This is how our program is structured**: \nThe core files are <b> main.ipynb</b>, <b>awareness.ipynb</b>, <b>simulation.ipynb</b> and <b>plot.ipynb</b>. The file <b>rk4.ipynb</b> includes the numerical approach to solve partial differential equations. The folder <b>data</b> stores the results of the executed computations. They provide the results used in the model's diagrams. The <b>figures</b>-folder holds the created figures while the <b>model</b>-folder contains custom made figures desribing the working of the model.<br><br>\n\nThe final code can be downloaded from the Github Repository at the following link:\n<b>https://github.com/Mela/Information-Travel-and-Pandemics</b><br>\n\nTo requirements for the setup are listed in the <b>requirements.txt</b> file. If the program is running in the deepnote environment these will be installed automatically. If the program is running in another one you have to run the \"pip install\" command.\n\n## Reading order\nOur suggested reading order for the different jupyter notebooks is as follows: <br>\n1. <b>documentation.ipynb</b> for the introduction, explaination of the model and the parameters <br> \n2. <b>main.ipynb</b> for run the main functions <br>\n3. <b>rk4.ipynb</b> for the algorihm to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) and a comparison between Runge-Kutta of 4th order (rk4) and the euler forward step method <br>\n4. optional: <b>example_heat.ipynb</b> for a simple example using rk4 and a model for the heat equation <br>\n5. <b>awareness.ipynb</b> is the file where SIR and awareness is modeled <br>\n6. <b>analysis.ipynb </b> is the file for run and evaluate the all of the simulations.\n",

The last compartment has zero awareness and therefore is not included in the sum. The average is taken over the grid.

   "source": "### Long Term Stability\n\nIn our model, that uses a superposition of SIR and information states for each individual, an outbreak won't completely die out just by chance. Instead, there will always be a small portion of infection remaining in the system. Thus, if the awareness level dropped to zero, a second outbreak might occur.\n\nA stable condition without awareness is reached, when the rate of new infections is less or equal to the rate of recovery with no awareness being present. This happens when a certain number of people have been removed from the susceptible compartment.\nFor our model, where we used $\\beta = \\gamma = 0.03$ this means that 3/4 of the population have to be removed from the susceptible pool as each individuals has four neighbors that they can infect with a rate of $\\beta$. This would correspond to a mean field SIR with $\\beta = 0.12,~\\gamma = 0.03$ => $R_0 = \\beta/\\gamma = 4$. \n\nHowever, both in the mean field approach and in our grid based model the outbreak will lead to a much higher amount of infected people than the stability threshold requires. This is because when the threshold for stability is reached ($R_{\\mathrm{eff}}=1$) there are still many infections present in the population which still generate new cases, even when the effective reproduction number is below one. Therefore, a lot more than 75&#8239;% of people might become infected over time.\n\nThe awareness in our model acts against overshooting the stability threshold.\nFor our default parameters the awareness reduces the number of recovered ones at $t = 1000$ to about 73&#8239;% with some awareness still remaining in the susceptible population, which will slow down any further spread while being below the threshold. (The threshold might also be slightly reduced by edge effects.)\n\nIf the stability threshold is reached, then no further outbreaks will occur even when the awareness has faded away (figure 8).\n\n<center>\n\n![](figures/evolution_default_extended.png)\n</center>\n<p style=\"font-size:8pt\"><b>Fig. 8</b> Long term stability when a total of 1 - 1/R_0 have been infected.</p><br>\n\n\n",

   "source": "## Particular Features of Our Model\n\n<i>Note: This section has not been part of our regular group work but rather came about during debugging and trying to understand why our model behaves in that specific way. It has lead to some backup slides of our presentation in case of more detailed questions about our model. As the findings give some interesting insights into the workings of our model, they are included here. Furthermore, it shows how important it is to carefully consider which aspects to put into a model.</i>\n\nWhen deciding how to build our model we decided to use a square lattice to reflect a very simple, local contact structure. This distinguishes our model from a mean field approach, where everybody is connected to everybody. As another simplification, we assumed the contact structure for the spread of infections and awareness to be the same.\n\nInstead of using a Monte Carlo simulation we decided to use the expectation values for the interactions instead and use a compartmentalized model, where each individual on the grid is in a superposition of different states.\n\nWe decided to have $3\\cdot 10 = 30$ compartments for each individual (3 for SIR, 10 for awareness) to reflect the correlations between awareness and the SIR state. For example an individual A might have a high awareness probability because individual A is partly infected, but that awareness should not reduce individual A's susceptibility for the part of individual A that is still susceptible.\n\nTo keep things simple and to reduce computation time we do not respect correlations between the SIR states of neighbors. This, however, means that an individual A could infect their neighbor (individual B) and individual B in turn can increase individual A's probability of infection. In that way the local behavior of our model is similar to a mean field approach.\n\nTo better understand the differences between a mean field approach, a Monte Carlo simulation on a grid (which automatically respects correlations between neighbors) and our superposition model, a quick Monte Carlo simulation and a mean field simulation have been written for an SIR model (without awareness, the models can be found in <code>model_inspection.ipynb</code>). To enable a better comparison, the Runge-Kutta method is dropped and the Euler forward method is used.\n\nWhen running the simulation with our default parameters, there is a huge difference in the results from the Monte Carlo method compared to the mean field analysis and our own model. The outbreak from the Monte Carlo simulation happenes considerably slower and has a real chance of dying out (see figure 14). Because the infections there either happen (with a set probability) or they don't happen (instead of using rates and averages), each individual effectively looses one neighbor to pass on the virus (the one that passed on the infection). Also, people in the same area often share their neighbors, thus further reducing the number of effective contacts.\n\n<center>\n\n![](figures/model_comparison_low_beta.png)\n</center>\n<p style=\"font-size:8pt\"><b>Fig. 14</b>  Comparison between mean field approach (green), our model (blue) and a Monte Carlo simulation (purple) on a square lattice with size 100x100 for an SIR model (no information/awareness). β = 0.03, γ = 0.03. Our model leads to a linear increase in active cases because of the circular pattern moving outwards. The Monte Carlo simulation (25 passes) leads to a much slower spread as the correlations between neighbours are not respected in our model. Here, the Monte Carlo simulation has the possibility to freeze out at low numbers and thus significantly reduces the total number of infections.</p><br>\n\n\n\n\n",

   "source": "# Conclusion\n\n1. **Which conditions can help to contain outbreaks through information spreading?**\n\nA high decay rate (ϱ) can \"freeze\" the outbreak if awareness is maintained for long.\n\n2. **What is the impact of self-isolation of knowingly infected individuals on the spread of a disease and under which conditions is it most impactful?**\n\nSelf-isolation will help limit the spread of the disease, yet it is harder to discern the ideal conditions.\n\nThe combination of parameters we chose for our model can lead to a containment of the disease. \nSelf-isolation will lead to a decline in infections. \n\n---\n\nWe think our model can be used to deepen the understanding how information influences infection patterns\n\nGiven more time to expand or enhance the model, it would have been interesting to add — for example — certain nodes enhancing higher quality information. This could have been influencers in the community like sport coaches, teachers, social workers, cultural or spiritual leaders, Another approach would have been to include clusters with individuals that can not be reached by information using traditional methods, like people highly influenced by anti-vaccine disinformation ([anti-vaxxers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01056-1)) or people lacking ressources to deal with the anxiety that comes with the incertainities of a pandemic, who tend to tune out information — called '[blunters](https://www.google.de/books/edition/The_Psychology_of_Pandemics/8mq1DwAAQBAJ?hl=de&gbpv=1&dq=The%20psychology%20of%20pandemics%20blunters&pg=PA44&printsec=frontcover)'.\n\nThe last worthwhile attempt we brainstormed was to expand the model to include the technique called \"[pre-bunking](https://firstdraftnews.org/articles/a-guide-to-prebunking-a-promising-way-to-inoculate-against-misinformation/)\", meaning the dissemination of high-quality information prior to the first infection in a community. \n\n\n## Limitations\n\nDue to time constraints we had to maintain a very basic model, lacking more complex approaches. The grid approach of four contacts per individual wont represent the communication, and infection, pattern of any community in a realistic fashion. We also had to limit the community size, to deal with limited computing power. The percentual approach would have run indefinitely, which is also a non-realistic outcome for a pandemic. Also, the neglectance of correlations between neighbours leads to deviations compared to a Monte Carlo Simulation. Randomization would have lead to more accurate results. \n\n",
